## Font Icon

This component will render any [icon](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons) 
defined in any stylesheet included in your project. You can use sites like [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) 
to generate custom font files, or use prebuilt fonts such as [Material icons](https://design.google.com/icons/) or 
[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) either included in your project, or served from a public 
[Content Delivery Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network). 

Refer to this [article](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web) to learn how to use font icons from any of the above websites in your project.

To use `FontIcon`, add the icon stylesheet to your project and reference the icon's class in the `className` prop. 
If  the icon font supports ligatures, reference the font in the `className` and enclose the icon name in the `FontIcon` 
tag.
